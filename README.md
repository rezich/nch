nch
===

nch is an experimental multimedia development framework ("game engine"). it's an entity-component system, hierarchical scene graph, and state management system all in one, with 2D vector graphics (for now). it's written in Nim because once the hard stuff gets nailed down (and it's getting there!), a lot of boilerplate code will be templated and macro'd away, allowing you to focus on making fun and interesting stuff (once you learn how the framework works of course) instead of dealing with mountains of setup code headaches.

Instructions
------------

extract `dlls.zip` and build with nimble. `import nch` into your own project, or build nch by itself to see a simple tech demo that illustrates whatever concepts I'm working on at the moment.
